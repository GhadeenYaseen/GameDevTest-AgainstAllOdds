## Description
Against All Odds is 3D co-op PC game where two local players work together to defeat an evil boss who has multiple timed attack patterns.
The game takes place in a fantasy world filled with magic and power.

### Game Mechanics
Two players, one PC, one enemy, infinite fights.

Enemy has multiple ways to attack the players; fire shooting, eagle landing, rocket throwing.
Players must stay alive and avoid damage, and defeat the enemy by throwing one of its own rocket back at it three times.
Players lose the fight if both lose all their lives.

Players can have as many rematches as possible, to score the highest score they can.

### Design
Upon reading the test description and inspecting the provided visual references, I mapped out the initial UI/UX design on Figma; so that I would have a constant blueprint throughout development.
