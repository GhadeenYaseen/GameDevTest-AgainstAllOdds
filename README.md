# Against All Odds
Is the name I chose for this game, the odds say that you are no match against a powerfull villan that has powers, but you have your partner! Your odds are 2 against 1.
But who shall win the fight?

## Description
Against All Odds is 3D co-op PC game where two local players work together to defeat an evil boss who has multiple timed attack patterns.
The game takes place in a fantasy world filled with magic and power.

I have considered this game as long term learning hcallenge, which means I will continue working on it until I feel there's no more room for improvements ^_^

### Game Mechanics
Two players, one PC, one enemy, infinite fights.

Enemy has multiple ways to attack the players; fire shooting, eagle landing, rocket throwing.
Players must stay alive and avoid damage, and defeat the enemy by throwing one of its own rocket back at it three times.
Players lose the fight if both lose all their lives.

Players can have as many rematches as possible, to score the highest score they can.

### How To Play
-------------- Disclaimer: No controller support, only split keyboard :0 ---------------------

Movement: player1 via WASD , player2 via arrow keys and numpad arrows. 
Jumping: player1 via left shift, player2 via space bar. 
Throw pickable rocket: both players share the shoot button, the zero number (not numpad). 

### Design
Upon reading the test description and inspecting the provided visual references, I mapped out the initial UI/UX design on Figma; so that I would have a constant blueprint throughout development.
Here is a link to the [Figma wireframe](https://www.figma.com/design/XpIQM2l6495vQvNZGLPQZl/AgainstAllOdds?node-id=0-1&t=SqiXHK66Drg8xIMC-1) for the game.

Game theme and aesthetic can be described with these keywords: fantasy, rpg, warm, red, lava, dark.
I kept in mind how my siblings and I used to play those split keyboard old flash games, and try to implement features that enhance thrill (sharing one shoot button). 
As well as fantasy games like League of Legends (for camera positioning).
